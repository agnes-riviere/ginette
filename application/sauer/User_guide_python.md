This User_guide will guide you step by step to help you complete the inversion based on the mini-LOMOS sensors, depending on how you chose to use it. 
Please refer to "LOMOS-mini: A coupled system quantifying transient water and heat exchanges in streambeds" from Cucchi et al. (2017) if you want to know more information about the monitoring system and to  "Experimental and numerical assessment of transient stream-aquifer exchange during disconnection" from Riviere et al. (2014) and ."Pore water pressure evolution below a freezing front under saturated conditions: Large-scale laboratory experiment and numerical investigation." RiviÃ¨re et al. (2019) for the numerical model.

### Prelude :
To Install Python: Python is a popular, high-level programming language that can be used for a wide range of tasks. Users can install Python by downloading the most recent version from the official website (https://www.python.org/) and then following the steps given.

#### required_modules

os, sys, numpy, pathlib, scipy, matplotlib, subprocess,rpy2, pandas

### 1) Launch the screening of multiple experiments of temperature and pressure in the HZ with the awk script inversion.awk from the terminal:

> python LOMOS_ginette.py

### 2) To run a simulation using nohup, you can use the following command:

> nohup python LOMOS_ginette.py &

This will run the simulation script in the background, even if you close the terminal window. The nohup command stands for "no hangup," and it prevents the process from being terminated when the terminal is closed. The & symbol at the end of the command causes the process to run in the background.
